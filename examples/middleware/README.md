# Middleware Example

This example demonstrates how to use middleware. To run the server, you'll need to make the library by running `make` from the root directory, then `make` this demo application and run the server with `./run.sh`.

Try sending a request with `curl https://localhost:5000/12` to observe the order in which the middleware runs.
