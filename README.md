# libhttp

A simple, concurrent TCP server and HTTP multi-plexer framework for the C programming language.
This library aims to be as simple as possible, offering an Express.js-like API and sensible defaults. libhttp is appropriate for most use-cases, with a tradeoff of support for rare use-cases in favor of simplicity and usability.

TODO: Docs (if you want to use this now, open an issue and I'll document this project with higher urgency)
